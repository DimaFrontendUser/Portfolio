            Our history

            And now we will say a few words about our company. We came into existence in 2005. Through the efforts of many people we were able to build great camps, a long search for good places to fish, we studied the landscape. Now we know all the trails of the beasts, we know all the nuances of the weather and any difficulties associated with fishing.

                    This is the year our story begins. It all began with one man, John Smith, and his dream of starting his own business. And since he had loved fishing since he was a kid, he didn't have to invent anything.

                    We set up the first camp, which initially accommodated only 10 fishermen. It took a long time to build, but it was solid, so we could use it for as long as possible. At the same time we studied the landscape and looked for places to fish.

                    This year there were already eight of us, and each year 200 fishermen began to come. The record fish caught this year was 20 pounds, which is quite a lot for a start-up company. But we didn't stop there!
