            <p>
                Anglers will eat in the large, comfortable dining room, with delicious meals featuring locally sourced ingredients like reindeer steaks from the tundra, spider crab from the arctic ocean and other delicacies from further afield.

                On warm summer evenings, anglers will be able to enjoy an icy beer ‘al fresco’, while prime rib sizzles on the outdoor barbeque. In autumn, the guests may choose to wrap up warm and huddle around the fire-pit to enjoy a nip of fine single malt whisky and gaze up at the northern lights or the sparkling stars of the northern sky.
