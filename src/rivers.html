            <p>During the first season in 2020, we will be flying our guests from Lovozero, which is another 1.5 hour drive from Murmansk airport, to the main camp at Lumbovka.We use the common MI-8 helicopter, which is considered one of the most reliable machines.</p>
            <p>Our remote positioning on Kola protects our camp from local poachers and proximity to the White sea enables autumn fishing for Osenkas.
            </p>
            <p>Our camp is outside of the ground military restriction zone, giving our guests comfort of being able to plan their holiday with confidence. At the same time, we are within air restriction area, thus we are still waiting to confirm the rotation days of the week.</p>
